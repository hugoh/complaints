    <p>Hello !</p>

    <p><i>(You're getting this email because this address has been
    registered on the website http://complaints.serfr1.org, and I have
    a few updates I'd like to share with all the users of that
    site.)</i>
    </p>

    <p><b>First: please re-enter your address !</b></p>

    <p>The address field in <a href="http://complaints.serfr1.org/profile">
        http://complaints.serfr1.org/profile</a> has been upgraded;
        just start typing your address, and it should auto-complete
        just like Google maps. Click on the correct address, and it
      will also regenerate your lat/long.</p>

    <p>It only takes a few seconds, but it's a huge help in helping me
    generate structured address info, which is what I need for the
    all-new non-email submittions system ... more below.</p>

    <p><b>A Wall of Shame: http://stop.jetnoise.net/report/yesterday</b></p>

    <p>This list is compiled from all of your reports from the day before,
    and gives a good summary of which planes and airlines you found
    most (and least !) annoying.</p>
    
    <p><b>Working with sfo.noise@flysfo.com.</b></p>

    <p>The volume of the emails we send has caused them some
    indigestion. I've spent the past month working with them,
    resending and reformatting all the complaints to make sure they
    will include them in their reports. No complaints have been lost
    (they were all in the database anyway), and things will run more
    smoothly in the future.</p>

    <p>We're moving to a new system that doesn't involve email - but
    requires accurate address information or the reports won't get
    accepted. So again,
    please <a href="http://complaints.serfr1.org/profile">check your
    profile</a>, reenter your address, and let Google maps
    auto-complete it.</p>
    
    <p><b>Rebranding: complaints are now reports</b></p>

    <p>A lot of people are put off 'complaining', as they don't like
    to think of themselves as 'complainers'. So now we are reporters
    of disturbances.</p>

    <p><b>A new name: http://stop.jetnoise.net/ </b></p>
    
    <p>The old name confused some people, who thought it was specific to
    SERFR1. In fact it works for anyone around SFO, under any of the
      flightpaths. So there is a new name, to make that clear.</p>

    <p> The old name will continue to work alongside the new one; both
    will work indefinitely, and it doesn't matter at all which you
    use, they both point to the same site. But I'll use the new name
    in announcements etc.</p>

    <p><b>A new getting started guide: http://stop.jetnoise.net/intro</b></p>

    <p> Want to tell your neighbors how to report disturbances ? Just
    give them that URL.</p>
    
    <p><b>Does it matter if a flight is not identified ? No.</b></p>

    <p>I'd just like to reassure people: it really doesn't matter if
    the site can't identify a particular aircraft. The SFO office
    doesn't do much with that information anyway, and they will still
    record your complaint (erm, report :) anyway. After all, most
    people can't identify flights when they phone in complaints.</p>

    <p>I think identifying the flight makes the whole process more
    engaging, and makes it more likely people will click on 'REPORT
    IT' - and we need lots of clicks (and more importantly, lots more
    people clicking). So I'll keep trying to make the flight
    identification work better for people, and fix it when it breaks.
    But it's basically for our own consumption, and has no impact on
      what happens to the reports/complaints we send in.</p>

    <p>So don't worry if the flight is not identified - your
    report/complaint will still count.</p>
    
    <p><b>Finally: I will be mostly offline for a while</b></p>

    <p>I'm travelling for the next 4-5 weeks, and mostly unable to do
    anything except read/write email. If something bad happens,
    apologies in advance - I won't be able to fix it until I get back
    :( But that's not too likely - the site's been running pretty well
    over the past month.</p>
